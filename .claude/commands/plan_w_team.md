# Plan With Team

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, and save a comprehensive specification document to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work. Follow the `Instructions` and work through the `Workflow` to create the plan.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT: $2 - (Optional) Guidance for team assembly, task structure, and execution strategy
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `specs/`
TEAM_MEMBERS: `.claude/agents/team/*.md`
GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT: `general-purpose`

## Instructions

- **PLANNING ONLY**: Do NOT build, write code, or deploy agents. Your only output is a plan document saved to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.
- If no `USER_PROMPT` is provided, stop and ask the user to provide it.
- If `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` is provided, use it to guide team composition, task granularity, dependency structure, and parallel/sequential decisions.
- Carefully analyze the user's requirements provided in the USER_PROMPT variable
- Determine the task type (chore|feature|refactor|fix|enhancement) and complexity (simple|medium|complex)
- Think deeply (ultrathink) about the best approach to implement the requested functionality or solve the problem
- Understand the codebase directly without subagents to understand existing patterns and architecture
- Follow the Plan Format below to create a comprehensive implementation plan
- Include all required sections and conditional sections based on task type and complexity
- Generate a descriptive, kebab-case filename based on the main topic of the plan
- Save the complete implementation plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<descriptive-name>.md`
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer could follow it to implement the solution
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate to clarify complex concepts
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns
- Understand your role as the team lead. Refer to the `Team Orchestration` section for more details.
- **CRITICAL — Testing Strategy**: Every plan MUST include a `## Testing Strategy` section defining the test pyramid for this feature. Follow the **80/15/5 ratio**: 80% unit tests, 15% integration/API tests, 5% UI e2e tests. A dedicated testing task MUST exist before the final validation task. Each implementation task should note what test coverage it requires in the `**Tests**` field.
- **CRITICAL — Context Routing**: Every task MUST include a `**Stack**` field with keywords from the **Section Routing Catalog** below. The builder agent uses keyword-based context routing to load coding standards. Without correct keywords, the builder works without project standards.
  - Always include at least one **stack keyword** (Java/React/Python) to select the correct stack
  - Then add **section keywords** matching what the task actually does (error handling, testing, etc.)
  - Example: a task creating a Spring controller with error handling → `Stack: Java Spring Boot controller exception error handling`
  - Example: a task writing MockMvc integration tests → `Stack: Java MockMvc integration test Testcontainers`
  - The Stop hook validator will reject plans where Stack keywords don't route to any section

#### Section Routing Catalog

Pick keywords from the **Trigger keywords** column. Each keyword you include loads the corresponding section into the builder's context.

### Team Orchestration

As the team lead, you have access to powerful tools for coordinating work across multiple agents. You NEVER write code directly - you orchestrate team members using these tools.

#### Task Management Tools

**TaskCreate** - Create tasks in the shared task list:
```typescript
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Implement user authentication",
  description: "Create login/logout endpoints with JWT tokens. See specs/auth-plan.md for details.",
  activeForm: "Implementing authentication"  // Shows in UI spinner when in_progress
})
// Returns: taskId (e.g., "1")
```

**TaskUpdate** - Update task status, assignment, or dependencies:
```typescript
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "1",
  status: "in_progress",  // pending → in_progress → completed
  owner: "builder-auth"   // Assign to specific team member
})
```

**TaskList** - View all tasks and their status:
```typescript
TaskList({})
// Returns: Array of tasks with id, subject, status, owner, blockedBy
```

**TaskGet** - Get full details of a specific task:
```typescript
TaskGet({ taskId: "1" })
// Returns: Full task including description
```

#### Task Dependencies

Use `addBlockedBy` to create sequential dependencies - blocked tasks cannot start until dependencies complete:

```typescript
// Task 2 depends on Task 1
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "2",
  addBlockedBy: ["1"]  // Task 2 blocked until Task 1 completes
})

// Task 3 depends on both Task 1 and Task 2
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "3",
  addBlockedBy: ["1", "2"]
})
```

Dependency chain example:
```
Task 1: Setup foundation     → no dependencies
Task 2: Implement feature    → blockedBy: ["1"]
Task 3: Write tests          → blockedBy: ["2"]
Task 4: Final validation     → blockedBy: ["1", "2", "3"]
```

#### Owner Assignment

Assign tasks to specific team members for clear accountability:

```typescript
// Assign task to a specific builder
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "1",
  owner: "builder-api"
})

// Team members check for their assignments
TaskList({})  // Filter by owner to find assigned work
```

#### Agent Deployment with Task Tool

**Task** - Deploy an agent to do work:
```typescript
Task({
  description: "Implement auth endpoints",
  prompt: "Implement the authentication endpoints as specified in Task 1...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",  // or "opus" for complex work, "haiku" for VERY simple
  run_in_background: false  // true for parallel execution
})
// Returns: agentId (e.g., "a1b2c3")
```

#### Resume Pattern

Store the agentId to continue an agent's work with preserved context:

```typescript
// First deployment - agent works on initial task
Task({
  description: "Build user service",
  prompt: "Create the user service with CRUD operations...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
})
// Returns: agentId: "abc123"

// Later - resume SAME agent with full context preserved
Task({
  description: "Continue user service",
  prompt: "Now add input validation to the endpoints you created...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  resume: "abc123"  // Continues with previous context
})
```

When to resume vs start fresh:
- **Resume**: Continuing related work, agent needs prior context
- **Fresh**: Unrelated task, clean slate preferred

#### Parallel Execution

Run multiple agents simultaneously with `run_in_background: true`:

```typescript
// Launch multiple agents in parallel
Task({
  description: "Build API endpoints",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Returns immediately with agentId and output_file path

Task({
  description: "Build frontend components",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Both agents now working simultaneously

// Check on progress
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: false,  // non-blocking check
  timeout: 5000
})

// Wait for completion
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: true,  // blocks until done
  timeout: 300000
})
```

#### Orchestration Workflow

1. **Create tasks** with `TaskCreate` for each step in the plan
2. **Set dependencies** with `TaskUpdate` + `addBlockedBy`
3. **Assign owners** with `TaskUpdate` + `owner`
4. **Deploy agents** with `Task` to execute assigned work
5. **Monitor progress** with `TaskList` and `TaskOutput`
6. **Resume agents** with `Task` + `resume` for follow-up work
7. **Mark complete** with `TaskUpdate` + `status: "completed"`

## Workflow

IMPORTANT: **PLANNING ONLY** - Do not execute, build, or deploy. Output is a plan document.

1. Analyze Requirements - Parse the USER_PROMPT to understand the core problem and desired outcome. If Serena MCP tools are available, call `read_memory` and `list_memories` to check for existing knowledge about related features or past decisions.
2. **Clarify Requirements (Interview Round 1)** — Analyze the USER_PROMPT for ambiguities before reading the codebase. Ask when:
   - **Contradiction detected** — the prompt contains two statements that conflict or imply mutually exclusive approaches (e.g., "return 409" and "silently succeed" for the same case)
   - **Underspecified behavior** — the prompt describes a feature but not what happens in key user states (unauthorized, empty data, error). If the prompt says "user clicks heart" but doesn't say what unauthorized user sees — ask.
   - **Multiple valid approaches** — you see two or more reasonable ways to implement something, each with different tradeoffs. Present both with pros/cons and ask which one.
   - **Design/UX choices** — visual placement, copy text, interaction details that are matters of taste, not engineering (e.g., "badge next to text or on icon?", "what message for empty state?")
   - **Scope ambiguity** — it's unclear whether adjacent features are in or out of scope (e.g., "also update admin panel?", "include tests in this task?")
   - Do NOT ask about things that have exactly one obvious answer from the prompt.
   - Do NOT ask about implementation details you can determine from the codebase — save those for step 4.
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` (supports 1-4 questions per call, call multiple times if needed).
3. Understand Codebase - Without subagents, directly understand existing patterns, architecture, and relevant files. If Serena MCP tools are available, prefer `find_symbol` and `get_symbols_overview` for navigating classes, methods, and dependencies instead of manual Glob/Grep. If Serena is not available, use Glob/Grep/Read as usual.
4. **Clarify Implementation (Interview Round 2)** — Now that you know the codebase, check for implementation-specific ambiguities. Ask when:
   - **Multiple patterns exist** — the codebase has more than one way to solve this type of problem, and it's not clear which fits better (e.g., "CartService uses optimistic UI, OrderService uses server-confirmed — which pattern for favorites?"). Present both with pros/cons.
   - **Technical tradeoff with no clear winner** — both options are valid and the choice depends on priorities the user hasn't stated (e.g., "denormalized counter is faster but can drift vs. COUNT query is accurate but slower")
   - **Integration ambiguity** — the existing code can accommodate the new feature in more than one place or way (e.g., "add to existing DTO or create a new one?", "extend current controller or create separate?")
   - **Discovered edge case** — reading the code revealed a scenario the prompt didn't address (e.g., "the material can be soft-deleted — should favorites to deleted materials auto-remove?")
   - Do NOT ask about things where the codebase has exactly one established pattern — just follow it.
   - Skip this step entirely if every implementation choice has a single obvious answer from the code.
5. Design Solution - Develop technical approach including architecture decisions and implementation strategy
6. Define Testing Strategy - Plan the test pyramid: 80% unit tests, 15% integration/API tests, 5% UI e2e tests. Map each test to the source code it validates. Reference existing test patterns from the codebase.
7. Define Team Members - Use `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` (if provided) to guide team composition. Identify from `.claude/agents/team/*.md` or use `general-purpose`. Include a test-builder member. Document in plan.
8. Define Step by Step Tasks - Use `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` (if provided) to guide task granularity and parallel/sequential structure. Write out tasks with IDs, dependencies, assignments, and `**Tests**` field. Always include a dedicated `write-tests` task before `validate-all`. Document in plan.
9. Generate Filename - Create a descriptive kebab-case filename based on the plan's main topic
10. Save Plan - Write the plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md`
11. Save & Report - Follow the `Report` section to write the plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md` and provide a summary of key components
12. Record Knowledge (Serena only) - If Serena MCP tools are available, call `write_memory` with a summary of: what was planned, key architectural decisions, patterns chosen, and any tradeoffs resolved during interviews. Use the plan filename as memory name. If Serena is not available, skip this step.

## Plan Format

- IMPORTANT: Replace <requested content> with the requested content. It's been templated for you to replace. Consider it a micro prompt to replace the requested content.
- IMPORTANT: Anything that's NOT in <requested content> should be written EXACTLY as it appears in the format below.
- IMPORTANT: Follow this EXACT format when creating implementation plans:

```md
# Plan: <task name>

## Task Description
<describe the task in detail based on the prompt>

## Objective
<clearly state what will be accomplished when this plan is complete>

<if task_type is feature or complexity is medium/complex, include these sections:>
## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this task addresses>

## Solution Approach
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it addresses the objective>
</if>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the task:

<list files relevant to the task with bullet points explaining why. Include new files to be created under an h3 'New Files' section if needed>

<if complexity is medium/complex, include this section:>
## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe any foundational work needed>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work>

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish
<describe integration, testing, and final touches>
</if>

## Team Orchestration

- You operate as the team lead and orchestrate the team to execute the plan.
- You're responsible for deploying the right team members with the right context to execute the plan.
- IMPORTANT: You NEVER operate directly on the codebase. You use `Task` and `Task*` tools to deploy team members to to the building, validating, testing, deploying, and other tasks.
  - This is critical. You're job is to act as a high level director of the team, not a builder.
  - You're role is to validate all work is going well and make sure the team is on track to complete the plan.
  - You'll orchestrate this by using the Task* Tools to manage coordination between the team members.
  - Communication is paramount. You'll use the Task* Tools to communicate with the team members and ensure they're on track to complete the plan.
- Take note of the session id of each team member. This is how you'll reference them.

### Team Members
<list the team members you'll use to execute the plan>

- Builder
  - Name: <unique name for this builder - this allows you and other team members to reference THIS builder by name. Take note there may be multiple builders, the name make them unique.>
  - Role: <the single role and focus of this builder will play>
  - Agent Type: <the subagent type of this builder, you'll specify based on the name in TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
  - Resume: <default true. This lets the agent continue working with the same context. Pass false if you want to start fresh with a new context.>
- <continue with additional team members as needed in the same format as above>

## Testing Strategy

Test pyramid ratio: **80% unit / 15% integration-API / 5% UI e2e**

### Unit Tests (80%)
<list unit tests to write: service logic, utility functions, component rendering, hooks. Each test class mirroring a source class.>

### Integration / API Tests (15%)
<list integration tests: controller endpoints with MockMvc/@WebMvcTest, repository tests with @DataJpaTest/Testcontainers, API contract tests.>

### UI E2E Tests (5%)
<list critical user flows to cover with e2e tests: login + action, full CRUD flow, cross-page navigation. Use Selenide/Playwright/Cypress as per project.>

## Step by Step Tasks

- IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom. Each task maps directly to a `TaskCreate` call.
- Before you start, run `TaskCreate` to create the initial task list that all team members can see and execute.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers. Start with foundational work, then core implementation, then testing, then validation.>

### 1. <First Task Name>
- **Task ID**: <unique kebab-case identifier, e.g., "setup-database">
- **Depends On**: <Task ID(s) this depends on, or "none" if no dependencies>
- **Assigned To**: <team member name from Team Members section>
- **Agent Type**: <subagent from TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
- **Stack**: <technology keywords for context routing, e.g., "Java Spring Boot JPA", "React Next.js", "Python FastAPI pytest">
- **Parallel**: <true if can run alongside other tasks, false if must be sequential>
- **Tests**: <what test coverage this task's code needs from Testing Strategy, e.g., "Unit: FavoriteServiceTest — add/remove/check. Integration: FavoriteControllerTest — all endpoints.">
- <specific action to complete>
- <specific action to complete>

### 2. <Second Task Name>
- **Task ID**: <unique-id>
- **Depends On**: <previous Task ID, e.g., "setup-database">
- **Assigned To**: <team member name>
- **Agent Type**: <subagent type from TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
- **Stack**: <technology keywords for context routing>
- **Parallel**: <true/false>
- **Tests**: <what test coverage this task's code needs>
- <specific action>
- <specific action>

### 3. <Continue Pattern>

### N-1. <Write Tests>
- **Task ID**: write-tests
- **Depends On**: <all implementation task IDs>
- **Assigned To**: <test-builder team member>
- **Agent Type**: builder
- **Stack**: <testing-specific keywords, e.g., "Java MockMvc Mockito assertj allure test structure" or "React jest testing-library tsx">
- **Parallel**: false
- Write unit tests (80%) as defined in Testing Strategy
- Write integration/API tests (15%) as defined in Testing Strategy
- Write UI e2e tests (5%) if defined in Testing Strategy
- Follow project test patterns (reference existing test files from Relevant Files)
- Allure/Jest/pytest annotations as per project convention

### N. <Final Validation Task>
- **Task ID**: validate-all
- **Depends On**: <all previous Task IDs including write-tests>
- **Assigned To**: <validator team member>
- **Agent Type**: <validator agent>
- **Stack**: <full stack keywords for validation>
- **Parallel**: false
- Run all validation commands
- Verify all tests pass (unit + integration + e2e)
- Verify acceptance criteria met

<continue with additional tasks as needed. Agent types must exist in .claude/agents/team/*.md>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

<list specific commands to validate the work. Be precise about what to run>
- Example: `uv run python -m py_compile apps/*.py` - Test to ensure the code compiles

## Notes
<optional additional context, considerations, or dependencies. If new libraries are needed, specify using `uv add`>
```

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
✅ Implementation Plan Created

File: PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>

Team Task List:
- <list of tasks, and owner (concise)>

Team members:
- <list of team members and their roles (concise)>

When you're ready, you can execute the plan in a new agent by running:
/smart_build <replace with path to plan>
```
